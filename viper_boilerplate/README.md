# How to use

1. In `root` folder, `yarn viper [SCREEN_NAME]`
2. Input the subpath under components directory that you'd like to add your screen.
3. Confirm files that will be added. (type Y or n)

# Example

```
# yarn viper AwesomeScreen

Input subpath under component folders:
fancyProject

Are you sure to generate these files?
../src/components/fancyProject/AwesomeScreen/AwesomeScreen.interactor.ts
../src/components/fancyProject/AwesomeScreen/AwesomeScreen.presenter.ts
../src/components/fancyProject/AwesomeScreen/AwesomeScreen.router.ts
../src/components/fancyProject/AwesomeScreen/index.tsx
